"The |georefRun|Â Georeferencer is a tool for generating world files for "
"rasters. It allows you to reference rasters to geographic or projected "
"coordinate systems by creating a new GeoTiff or by adding a world file to"
" the existing image. The basic approach to georeferencing a raster is to "
"locate points on the raster for which you can accurately determine "
"coordinates."

"The **Linear** algorithm is used to create a world file and is different "

"is just missing georeferencing information. At least 2 GCPs are needed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/user_manual/working_with_raster/georeferencer.rst:164
msgid ""
"The **Helmert** transformation also allows rotation. It is particularly "

"aerial image, but not aligned with the grid bearing in your CRS. At least"
" 2 GCPs are needed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/user_manual/working_with_raster/georeferencer.rst:167
msgid ""
"The **Polynomial 1** algorithm allows a more general affine "
"transformation, in particular also a uniform shear. Straight lines remain"
" straight (i.e., collinear points stay collinear) and parallel lines "
"remain parallel. This is particularly useful for georeferencing data "
"cartograms, which may have been plotted (or data collected) with "
"different ground pixel sizes in different directions. At least 3 GCP's "
"are required."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/user_manual/working_with_raster/georeferencer.rst:171
msgid ""
"The **Polynomial** algorithms 2-3 use more general 2nd or 3rd degree "
"polynomials instead of just affine transformation. This allows them to "
"account for curvature or other systematic warping of the image, for "
"instance photographed maps with curving edges. At least 6 (respectively "
"10) GCP's are required. Angles and local scale are not preserved or "
"treated uniformly across the image. In particular, straight lines may "
"become curved, and there may be significant distortion introduced at the "
"edges or far from any GCPs arising from extrapolating the data-fitted "
"polynomials too far."

"The **Projective** algorithm generalizes Polynomial 1 in a different way,"
" allowing transformations representing a central projection between 2 "
"non-parallel planes, the image and the map canvas. Straight lines stay "
"straight, but parallelism is not preserved and scale across the image "
"varies consistently with the change in perspective. This transformation "
"type is most useful for georeferencing angled photographs (rather than "
"flat scans) of good quality maps, or oblique aerial images. A minimum of "
"4 GCPs is required."

"Finally, the **Thin Plate Spline** (TPS) algorithm \"rubber sheets\" the "
"raster using multiple local polynomials to match the GCPs specified, with"
" overall surface curvature minimized. Areas away from GCPs will be moved "
"around in the output to accommodate the GCP matching, but will otherwise "
"be minimally locally deformed.Â  TPS is most useful for georeferencing "
"damaged, deformed, or otherwise slightly inaccurate maps, or poorly "
"orthorectified aerials.Â  It is also useful for approximately "
"georeferencing and implicitly reprojecting maps with unknown projection "
"type or parameters, but where a regular grid or dense set of ad-hoc GCPs "
"can be matched with a reference map layer. It technically requires a "
"minimum of 10 GCPs, but usually more to be successful."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/user_manual/working_with_raster/georeferencer.rst:188
msgid ""
"In all of the algorithms except TPS, if more than the minimum GCPs are "
"specified, parameters will be fitted so that the overall residual error "
"is minimized. This is helpful to minimize the impact of registration "
"errors, i.e. slight imprecisions in pointer clicks or typed coordinates, "
"or other small local image deformations. Absent other GCPs to compensate,"
" such errors or deformations could translate into significant "
"distortions, especially near the edges of the georeferenced image.Â  "
"However, if more than the minimum GCPs are specified, they will match "
"only approximately in the output. In contrast, TPS will precisely match "
"all specified GCPs, but may introduce significant deformations between "
"nearby GCPs with registration errors."
