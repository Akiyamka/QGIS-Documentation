"Vector tiles are packets of geographic data, packaged into pre-defined "
"roughly-square shaped \"tiles\" for transfer over the web. They combine "
"pre-rendered raster map tiles and vector map tiles. The vector tile "
"server returns vector map data, which has been clipped to the boundaries "
"of each tile, instead of a pre-rendered map image. The clipped tiles "
"represent the zoom-levels of the vector tile service, derived from a "
"pyramid approach. Using this structure, the data-transfer is reduced in "
"comparison to un-tiled vector maps. Only data within the current map "
"view, and at the current zoom level need to be transferred. Also, "
"compared to a tiled raster map, data transfer is also greatly reduced, as"
" vector data is typically much smaller than a rendered bitmap. Vector "
"tiles do not have any styling information assigned so QGIS needs to apply"
" a cartographic style in order to display the data."
