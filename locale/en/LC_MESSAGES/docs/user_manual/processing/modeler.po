"The *graphical modeler* allows you to create complex models using a "
"simple and easy-to-use interface. When working with a GIS, most analysis "
"operations are not isolated, rather part of a chain of operations. Using "
"the graphical modeler, that chain of operations can be wrapped into a "
"single process, making it convenient to execute later with a different "
"set of inputs. No matter how many steps and different algorithms it "
"involves, a model is executed as a single algorithm, saving time and "
