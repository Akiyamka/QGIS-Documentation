"The complexity of the QGIS source code has increased considerably during "

"very long release cycles because it was a lot of work to reestablish the "
"stability of the software system after new features were added. To "
"overcome these problems, QGIS switched to a development model where new "
"features are coded in GIT branches first and merged to master (the main "
"branch) when they are finished and stable. This section describes the "
