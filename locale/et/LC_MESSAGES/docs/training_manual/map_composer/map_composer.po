"Now that you've got a map, you need to be able to print it or to export it "
"to a document. The reason is, a GIS map file is not an image. Rather, it "
"saves the state of the GIS program, with references to all the layers, their"
" labels,colors, etc. So for someone who doesn't have the data or the same "
"GIS program (such as QGIS), the map file will be useless. Luckily, QGIS can "
"export its map file to a format that anyone's computer can read, as well as "
"printing out the map if you have a printer connected. Both exporting and "
"printing is handled via the *Print Layout*."
