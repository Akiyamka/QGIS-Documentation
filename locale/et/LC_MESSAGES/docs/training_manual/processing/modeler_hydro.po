"The first model that we created in the previous chapter was a very simple "
"one, with just one input and three algorithms. More complex models can be "
"created, with different types of inputs and containing more steps. For this "
"chapter we will work with a model that creates a vector layer with "
"watersheds, based on a DEM and a threshold value. That will be very useful "
"for calculating several vector layers corresponding to different thresholds,"
" without having to repeat each single step each time."
