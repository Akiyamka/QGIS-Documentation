"In the previous topics we have taken a closer look at vector data. While "
"vector features use geometry (points, polylines and polygons) to represent "
"the real world, raster data takes a different approach. Rasters are made up "
"of a matrix of pixels (also called cells), each containing a value that "
"represents the conditions for the area covered by that cell (see "
"figure_raster_). In this topic we are going to take a closer look at raster "
"data, when it is useful and when it makes more sense to use vector data."

"在上一章中我们介绍了矢量数据的一些特征。和矢量数据用几何元素（点，线，面）来表示真实地物不同，栅格数据用的是像素矩阵（也称像元），其中每一个像元的值代表该像元覆盖区域的某种属性（如图）。在这一章中我们我们会更详细地介绍栅格数据，他们的用途以及，在什么情况下用栅格比矢量更适合。"

"Raster data is used in a GIS application when we want to display information"
" that is continuous across an area and cannot easily be divided into vector "
"features. When we introduced you to vector data we showed you the image in "
"figure_landscape_. Point, polyline and polygon features work well for "
"representing some features on this landscape, such as trees, roads and "
"building footprints. Other features on a landscape can be more difficult to "
"represent using vector features. For example the grasslands shown have many "
"variations in colour and density of cover. It would be easy enough to make a"
" single polygon around each grassland area, but a lot of the information "
"about the grassland would be lost in the process of simplifying the features"
" to a single polygon. This is because when you give a vector feature "
"attribute values, they apply to the whole feature, so vectors aren't very "
"good at representing features that are not homogeneous (entirely the same) "
"all over. Another approach you could take is to digitise every small "
"variation of grass colour and cover as a separate polygon. The problem with "
"that approach is that it will take a huge amount of work in order to create "
"a good vector dataset."

"在GIS应用中，栅格数据通常用于表示在空间上连续变化的信息，这类信息往往难以在进行分割之后用矢量数据来表示。在介绍矢量数据的时候我们展示了一张图，其中点、线、面能很好地表现诸如树，道路，建筑等地物的信息。然而有一些地物特征是难以用矢量数据来表达的，比如说草地的颜色和覆被密度。如果简单地用一个面元素来表示整片草地，那草地内部的许多变量信息就会因简化而丢失。当你对一个矢量对象进行赋值时，该属性值会被赋予矢量所代表的的整个区域，所以矢量数据并不适合用于表示非同质性（内部属性保持高度一致）的地物。或者你也可以根据草的颜色和密度将草地分成很多很小的部分并各自用不同的面元素来表示，但如果你想得到好的结果，这将会是一个很大的工程。"

"Some features on a landscape are easy to represent as points, polylines and "
"polygons (e.g. trees, roads, houses). In other cases it can be difficult. "
"For example how would you represent the grasslands? As polygons? What about "
"the variations in colour you can see in the grass? When you are trying to "
"represent large areas with continuously changing values, raster data can be "
"a better choice."

"有些地物（像树，道路和建筑）用点、线、面来表示比较简单，但别的就比较困难了。比如说草地要怎么表示？用面元素？那颜色的变化要怎么体现呢？当你需要表示这种大范围连续变化的区域的时候，用栅格数据可能会更好。"

"Using raster data is a solution to these problems. Many people use raster "
"data as a **backdrop** to be used behind vector layers in order to provide "
"more meaning to the vector information. The human eye is very good at "
"interpreting images and so using an image behind vector layers, results in "
"maps with a lot more meaning. Raster data is not only good for images that "
"depict the real world surface (e.g. satellite images and aerial "
"photographs), they are also good for representing more abstract ideas. For "
"example, rasters can be used to show rainfall trends over an area, or to "
"depict the fire risk on a landscape. In these kinds of applications, each "
"cell in the raster represents a different value e.g. risk of fire on a scale"
" of one to ten."

"使用栅格数据是解决这类问题的一个方法。因为人眼对于矢量数据后的图像信息是比较敏感的， "
"所以有很多人会在矢量数据的后面加上栅格的底图以丰富数据信息。除了用于表示真实地表（如卫星与航空遥感图像），栅格数据还可以用于表达更抽象的属性，例如区域内的降雨趋势，发生火灾的风险等。在这类应用中，栅格的每一个像元值都代表不同的涵义（如用一到十来衡量火灾风险等级）"
