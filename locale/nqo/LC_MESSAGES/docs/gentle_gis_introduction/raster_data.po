"Raster data is used in a GIS application when we want to display information"

"attribute values, they apply to the whole feature, so vectors aren't very "
"good at representing features that are not homogeneous (entirely the same) "
"all over. Another approach you could take is to digitise every small "

"Using raster data is a solution to these problems. Many people use raster "
