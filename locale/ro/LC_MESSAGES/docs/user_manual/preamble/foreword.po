"QGIS is an Open Source Geographic Information System. The project was born "
"in May 2002 and was established as a project on SourceForge in June the same"
" year. We have worked hard to make GIS software (which is traditionally "
"expensive proprietary software) available to anyone with access to a "
"personal computer. QGIS currently runs on most Unix platforms, Windows, and "
"macOS. QGIS is developed using the Qt toolkit (https://www.qt.io) and C++. "
"This means that QGIS feels snappy and has a pleasing, easy-to-use graphical "
"user interface (GUI)."

"QGIS aims to be a user-friendly GIS, providing common functions and "
"features. The initial goal of the project was to provide a GIS data viewer. "
"QGIS has reached the point in its evolution where it is being used for daily"
" GIS data-viewing needs, for data capture, for advanced GIS analysis, and "
"for presentations in the form of sophisticated maps, atlases and reports. "
"QGIS supports a wealth of raster and vector data formats, with new format "
"support easily added using the plugin architecture."
